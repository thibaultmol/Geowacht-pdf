This is just a small little project to take the on-duty sheets from Geowacht (the Belgian pharmacy on-duty scheduling system) and display them one at a time on a pc/tablet.
I do not own the pdf's that it downloads/produces!
I only own the code that makes it happen.

Also keep in mind that this project is only pulling the on-duty cards for our specific pharmacy.
If you want to fork this to work for your own pharmacy, modify the '371201' number in the Github Actions Workflow to your own.

Then just put your tablet/pc is fullscreen/kiosk mode on the Github Pages url.
It will auto change the pdf it's displaying two times a week
